## Introduction

Forest fires are a major environmental threat, with devastating impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human populations. Early detection can greatly mitigate the damage caused by these fires. This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically detect forest fires from images, aiming for faster and more efficient identification of fire-prone areas.

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of images labeled as either containing forest fires or not. It was preprocessed using image augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to enhance model performance. The images were resized and normalized before being fed into the model.

- **Classes**: Fire, No Fire
- **Image Dimensions**: 128x128
- **Augmentation**: Yes

## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a custom CNN model for image classification. The architecture is designed with several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and dense layers to make predictions. A softmax layer is applied for binary classification.

Key Layers:
- Convolutional Layers (for feature extraction)
- Pooling Layers (for dimensionality reduction)
- Fully Connected Layers (for classification)
- Dropout Layers (to avoid overfitting)

### Model Summary
```
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
================================================================
conv2d (Conv2D)              (None, 128, 128, 32)      896
max_pooling2d (MaxPooling2D) (None, 64, 64, 32)        0
...
dense (Dense)                (None, 1)                 129

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/forest-fire-detection.git
   cd forest-fire-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `/data`).

## Usage

1. Preprocess the images:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. To detect fires in a new image:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image-path /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Results

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of **96.4%** on the test dataset

Sample predictions:

| Image       | Predicted Label | Confidence |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| image1.jpg  | Fire            | 95%        |
| image2.jpg  | No Fire         | 99%        |

## Future Improvements

- **Transfer Learning**: Implementing pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Real-time Detection**: Extending the project to include real-time video feed analysis for forest fire detection.
- **NLP Integration**: Adding an NLP chatbot that can interact with users, provide fire prevention tips, and notify emergency services.
